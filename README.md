# space_invaders
A look-alike of famous "Space Invaders", created during my "Introduction to Programming" course.
cannon.c is a source code file containing the game itself. SDL library functions were accessed through a wrapper library "primlib.c". The details on how the workspace should be configured can be found here: http://fiona.dmcs.p.lodz.pl/pp/graphmanual.html.
